## Bug Fixing Submissions

Each participant should:

1. Submit the corrected code

2. Comment a short explanation of:
   - What the bug was
   - How they identified it
   - Why their fix is correct

3. Optional: Add a test/assertion or output sample proving it works correctly

Place the corrected code of your choosing in a folder here, naming the folder using the format, first_name-last_name.
